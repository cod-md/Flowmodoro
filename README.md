# Flowmodoro

**Flowmodoro** is a minimal, open-source Pomodoro timer web app designed with unique features that make it more practical and user-friendly—especially for people who study with earbuds on and don’t want to interact with their devices during focus sessions.

## ✨ Features

- 🔔 **Distinct Sounds** for each transition:
  - One sound for **starting a break**
  - Another sound for **resuming study**
- 🔁 **Automatic Transitions**:
  - No need to touch your phone or laptop
  - Seamless switching between study and break sessions
- 🎧 **Optimized for Earbud Users**:
  - Just put on your earbuds, start the timer, and focus—Flowmodoro will notify you when it’s time to switch modes

## 📦 Use Case

You’re deep into a 25-minute study session with earbuds in. When time’s up, you’ll hear a **break notification sound**, signaling it’s time to step away. After your break (say 5 minutes), you’ll hear a **study reminder sound**, guiding you back to work—**without ever looking at your screen**.
